## Abstract

Whether you're doing a simple data analysis project on your own or writing a large piece of complex software with a team of other people, using a robust version control system will make your life easier. One of the most popular systems is [git](https://git-scm.com/). 

Git can:

- help you track changes in your code over time
- try out radically different approaches without fear of losing your work
- collaborate with other people incorporating their work into yours in a managed way

This session will touch on R only slightly, providing instead a broadly language-agnostic introduction to the key features of git. We'll cover the benefits of version controlling your code, the concepts behind git, and how to use it in practice.
