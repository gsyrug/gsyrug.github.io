## Abstract

Just as learning French can help you learn Spanish, learning other programming languages might help you learn R better.
In this session we'll have a brief introduction to three less well-known languages that I believe will enhance your perspective on R.

The languages are:

- Lisp
- Haskell
- APL

While all are welcome, this session is aimed more at people who are comfortable enough with R to start thinking about expanding their knowledge to other languages. 
That said, we'll not be going any more than surface level of any of the other languages, so beginners may still get something out of the session.

## Slides

Will be published after the event.
