## Abstract

R is not known to be the fastest of languages, but there are several ways to make your code faster.
We'll cover considerations about data storage and structure, efficient programming patterns, and quick third-party libraries.
We'll also discuss when you would want to work on making your code more efficient and why it might not always be the best idea.

## Slides

Slides will be published after the event.
